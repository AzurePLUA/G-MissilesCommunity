# Gmissiles

This is the original repository for GMissiles, a small mod for garrys mod that adds new missile entities. Press (Your USE/Interact key on them) to launch them, or use Wire mod for more advanced control. 
GMissiles has guided missiles that can fully track and hit targets such as NPC's, Vehicles, Thrusters, or even players.

The goal of opening this to the community is so that others can contribute to adding many more missiles/launchers/features ect...

Currently gmissiles is getting reworked to a better system using a base entity (Gmissiles_Base) and all missiles are being ported to the new format
